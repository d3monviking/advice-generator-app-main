<h2>Advice Generator App </h2>
<br>
Advice Generator App is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I created the project on top of a Frontend Mentor <a href = "https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db">template</a> to practice my Frontend development skills. 
<br>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript and API</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project details</h3>
<p>Advice Generator App uses Advice Slip JSON API to fetch new promises whenever the user clicks on the advice icon. When the webpage is in active state (upon clicking the advice button), the quote and advice ID changes as per the data fetch by the API.</p>

<h3>Learnings/Topics Practiced</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using Flexbox to align the content in the container</li>
  <li>Using "position" property to align a div halfway through the container and background</li>
  <li>Using async functions to fetch data and parse the promise into an object</li>
  <li>Tackled UI problem: Whenever the advice texts were bigger, they overflowed through the container. I used if/else condition to restrict the advice length.</li>
</ul>
